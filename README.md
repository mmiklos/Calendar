Calendar
========

Building on my knowledge of JS to create a functional calendar

Please Note: This is setup on my computer using Xampp local apache server. Nothing will work until the database
is setup and a local server is running. The database is mysql and the code can be copy/pasted from the dbContent.sql file
which contains the info hardcoded into the config file. 

As this is mostly a JS project, much of the php is unused, or used for testing.
